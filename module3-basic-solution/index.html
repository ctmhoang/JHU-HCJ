                <p>
                    (The whole family is having dinner. George is working on his reports and watching TV. David and Linda, Marty's siblings are there as well. David is dressed in his work clothes, a fast food restaurant outfit.) Believe me, Marty, you're better off not having to worry about all the aggravation and headaches of playing at that dance. He's absolutely right, Marty. the last thing you need is headaches. (Marty's mother, Loraine, enters and drops a cake onto the table. She's a plump woman who tends to drink somewhat.) Kids, we're gonna have to eat this cake by ourselves, Uncle Joey didn't make parole again. I think it would be nice, if you all dropped him a line.(The painting on screen disappears to reveal Needles.) Hey, hey, the big M! How's it hanging McFly? Hey Needles. (Closet) (o.s) So...What'd you call me, Griff? Chicken, McFly. (The sound effects of a chicken play again.) Nobody calls me....(He sees Griff's bat.) …chicken. (smiles faintly, a sort of "oops" smile) (Griff gets his baseball bat and charges for Marty.)Sure he's here. Everybody's here tonight. You gentlemen are gonna have to check your firearms if you want to join in on the festivities. (laughs) And who's gonna make us, tender-foot...you? I am. (Buford turns to see Marshall Strickland with a rifle aimed at Buford's shoulder.) Marshall Strickland. I didn't know you was back in town.Yeah, yeah what are you wearing, Dave. Marty, I always wear a suit to the office. You alright? Yeah. (Lorraine and George walk in the back door. Lorraine is skinny and they both look great.) I think we need a rematch.Alright Doc, what's going on, huh? Where are we? When are we? (Doc lifts up his glasses and looks at the time display.) We are descending towards Hill Valley, California, at 4.29pm, on Wednesday, October 21st, 2015. 2015? You mean we're in the future? Future, Marty? What do you mean? How can we be in the future?Yep. Doc, what about Jennifer, what about Einstein? We can't just leave them here! Don't worry Marty, assuming we succeed in our mission this alternative 1985 will be changed back to the real 1985, instantaneously transforming around Jennifer and Einie. Jennifer and Einie will be fine, and they will have absolutely no memory of this horrible place! Doc, what if we don't succeed? We must succeed!Nobody calls me chicken, Needles, nobody! All right, prove it. All right, all right Needles, here's my card, scan it, I'm in. Thanks McFly. See you at the plant tomorrow. (Needles "hangs up" and the screen has the AT&T logo on it.)(confused) Where? (in a what's-wrong-with-you voice) Back to the future! (with conviction) Right. Let's get going. (he sets down his glass) Great. Gentlemen, excuse me, but my friend and I have to catch a train.Just finishing up the second coat now. Now Biff, don't con me. I'm, I'm sorry, Mr. McFly, I mean, I was just starting on the second coat. That Biff, what a character. (goes back inside) Always trying to get away with something. Been on top of Biff ever since high school. Although, if it wasn't for him… We never would have fallen in love.No no no this sucker's electrical, but I need a nuclear reaction to generate the one point twenty-one gigawatts of electricity… What did I just say? (Marty rewinds the tape and plays it again.) No no no this sucker's electrical, but I need a nuclear reaction to generate the one point twenty-one gigawatts of electricity that I need. One point twenty-one gigawatts! One point twenty-one gigawatts! Great Scott. (runs out of the workshop.)(Marty looks at the paper again.) Hey Doc, this date...wait, this is tomorrow's newspaper! Precisely! I already went further ahead into time to see what else happens. I backtracked everything to this one event, that's why we're here today to prevent this incident from ever happening. (His watch beeps.) Damn, I'm late! Wait a minute, where are you going now? To intercept the real Marty Junior, you're taking his place. Round the corner at the Café 80's, guy named Griff, just say no!(Doc waves at Clara and she waves back before going inside. Doc and Marty get on their horses and ride away.) What do ya mean, you're gonna be seein' lots of her, Doc? Well...I might see her again, just in passing. (laughs) C'mon, Doc, did you see the way she was looking at you? Well, she did have quite a scare, right? After all, Miss Clayton almost ended up at the bottom of Clayton Ravine. (he stops as he realizes what he just said) Clayton Ravine...Your not gonna be picking a fight, Dad, dad dad daddy-o. You're coming to a rescue, right? Okay, let's go over the plan again. 8:55, where are you gonna be. I'm gonna be at the dance. Right, and where am I gonna be? You're gonna be in the car with her. Right, okay, so right around 9:00 she's gonna get very angry with me.
