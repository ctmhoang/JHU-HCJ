                        (Marty runs off, terrified.) Argh! (Courthouse Square) (Marty runs up and ends up standing on a sign. It's the "Welcome to the City of Hill Valley A Nice Place To Live" sign. It's been changed so it now says "Hell Valley" and also has bullet holes in it. In the square he bumps in to Red, the bum we saw at the end of Part 1 when Marty re-entered 1955. He's also a bum in this reality.) Watch where you're going, crazy drunk pedestrian!Well uh, good, fine. Oh, I've been so worried about you ever since you ran off the other night. Are you okay? (the bell rings) I'm sorry I have to go. (to her friends as she passes by Doc) Isn't he a dream boat? Doc, she didn't even look at him. This is more serious than I thought. Apparently your mother is amorously infatuated with you instead of your father. Whoa, wait a minute, Doc, are you telling me that my mother has got the hots for me?(w.t) I dunno! (v.o) Well, do you have any idea where he is? (w.t) No, he could be anywhere by now! (Lyon Estates) (w.t) Marty, the entire future depends on you finding Biff and getting that book back!(Just then the Delorean passes the windmill.) (into walkie-talkie) The windmill! Doc, the windmill! We're goin' past 60! You'll never make it! (into walkie-talkie) Then we'll have to take her back with us! Keep calling out the speed! (Doc turns to Clara and shouts to her.) Clara, climb out here to me! I don't know if I can! You can do it! Just don't look down...that's it!Ahh! Party's over Biff. (He throws the remote in the Jacuzzi.) Sorry ladies. How'd you get past my security downstairs? There's a little matter we need to talk about. Yeah, money, right? Well forget it!Strickland! (They hit Strickland's porch, destroying a few flower pots, and Marty ducks for cover. Strickland comes back with a gun and fires it.) Eat lead, slackers! (Marty runs off, terrified.) Argh!Flux capacitor. It works, (laughs), it works. I finally invent something that works. Bet your ass it works. Well, now we gotta sneak this back into my laboratory, we've gotta get you home. Okay Doc, this is it.(she slaps him) Shut your filthy mouth, I'm not that kind of girl. Well maybe you are and you just don't know it yet. Get your meat hooks off of me. You heard her she said get your meat hooks, off, (Biff stands up and he's at least a foot taller than Marty) uh please. So what's it to you, butthead. You know you've been looking for a… (spots Strickland over Marty's shoulder) since you're new here, I'm gonna cut you a break, today. So why don't you make like a tree, and get out of here.The future, it's where you're going? That's right, twenty five years into the future. I've always dreamed on seeing the future, looking beyond my years, seeing the progress of mankind. I'll also be able to see who wins the next twenty-five world series. Uh, Doc. Huh? Uh, look me up when you get there.(breaks off the handlebars) Look, I need to borrow your...hoverboard? (Griff’s gang run out of the café.) Where is he? (Marty hands the handlebars back to the little girl.) Here.(The Courthouse is still there, only now it’s the Courthouse Mall. The clock in the Clock Tower still says 10:04. Marty looks around and sees that the road has a “No Landing” painted on it. There are cars flying all around and Marty can see the skyway from where he stands. Looking up at the Courthouse, he sees that instead of a car park, the central area of the Square now has a nice pond and tropical plants. Marty turns to look behind him and we see that the Texaco station has also changed. It’s now 2 levels. One for hover-converted cars, and one for ground cars.) Welcome to Texaco. You can trust your car with the system with the star. Checking oil, checking landing gear... (Marty looks over and sees that the movie theater is now a Holomax, and Jaws 19 is showing. Marty looks the other way and a holographic shark comes out of the Holomax sign, creeping towards him. It’s just about to ‘eat’ him when Marty turns around and sees it. Marty covers his head and ducks a bit.) Argh!!! (The shark then disappears. Marty straightens up and sees people giving him some strange looks.)

                        I told you Grandma, I'm going to the dance! (We cut to the garage, where Marty is listening.) (v.o) When are you coming home? The dance! I'll get home when I get home! (He enters the garage.)Of course it's erased! But what does that mean? It means that your future hasn't been written yet. No one's has. Your future is whatever you make it. So make it a good one. Both of you! Firmly, waving. We will, Doc! Stand back! (to his boys as the doors close) All right, boys, buckle up!(George is off to the side dancing by himself.) We're gonna take a little break but we'll be back in a while so, don't nobody go no where. (The Parking Lot) Marty, why are you so nervous? Loraine, have you ever, uh, been in a situation where you know you had to act a certain way but when you got there, you didn't know if you could go through with it?I don't like her, Marty. Any girl who calls a boy is just asking for trouble. Oh Mom, there's nothing wrong with calling a boy. I think it's terrible. Girls chasing boys. When I was your age I never chased a boy, or called a boy, or sat in a parked car with a boy. Then how am I supposed to ever meet anybody. Well, it will just happen. Like the way I met your father.(Marty is rewinding the video he shot of the time travel test with 1985 Doc.) Something wrong with the starter, so I hid it. After I fell off my toilet, I drew this. (He holds up a crude drawing of the flux capacitor.) Flux capacitor. It works, (laughs), it works. I finally invent something that works.(Marty walks over to the girls he borrowed the hoverboard from.) Hey kid, little girl, thanks. Keep it, I've got a Pit Bull now. Come on. (They walk off to see what's going on at the Mall. They have Griff's Pit Bull. An old man, Terry, approaches Marty.)Great Scott! (he stops his horse) Then she was supposed to go over in that wagon...and now, I may have seriously altered history. Look, Doc, what's the worst that could happen, huh? So they don't name the ravine after her. Let's just get the Delorean ready and get the hell out of here. I wish I'd never invented that infernal time machine...it's caused nothing but disaster. (He rides away slowly. After a moment Marty follows him.) (Blacksmith shop.)(Lyon Estates) (Meanwhile the DeLorean takes off and accidentally hits the Lyon Estates billboard.) Damn! (He accidentally turns the time circuits on, and the bump causes the Destination Time to turn to JAN 01 1885 12 00. Doc doesn't notice though. The DeLorean flies off with a flag pennant attached to the rear wheel.) (School – The Dance)(Marty has heard her this time!) Of course! (w.t) I gotta go, I got one chance, my old man's about to deck Biff! (Outside) (George hits Biff in the face. Biff falls down to the floor. George looks at his fist with a "I can't believe it! I did it!" expression and then turns to Lorraine.) Yes!

                        Ah, I'm...I'm fine. Thanks. (He turns and spots Doc. He heads over to him. Doc is smelling a flower that was given to him by Clara.) Doc. What are you doing? (stops sniffing) Oh, nothing...just out enjoying the morning air. It's really lovely here in the morning, don't you think? Yeah, it's lovely Doc. Listen, we gotta load the Delorean. We gotta get ready to roll alright...(he spots the tombstone from the picture) hey look at that, the tombstone.(And old man laughs.) If everybody's got one of these automo-whatsits, does anybody walk or run anymore? Of course they run. But for recreation, for fun. Run for fun? Ha-ha, what the hell kind of fun is that? (Another old man begins to laugh.)(They go to kiss but a woman shoves a flyer in their faces.) Save the clock tower, save the clock tower. Mayor Wilson is sponsoring an initiative to replace that clock. Thirty years ago, lightning struck that clock tower and the clock hasn't run since. We at the Hill Valley Preservation Society think it should be preserved exactly the way it is as part of our history and heritage. Here you go, lady. There's a quarter. (drops a quarter into her collection tin.) Thank you, don't forget to take a flyer. Right.(DeLorean) (w.t) That was a close one Marty, I almost bought the farm! (Street) (w.t) Be careful, you don't want to get struck by lightning- (But Doc does. The DeLorean is struck, causing it to spin around and accelerate until it reaches 88mph. With a flash the DeLorean disappears.)(He passes the book to 1955 Biff. Obviously 1955 Biff thinks this is a load crap.) Well, that's very nice, thank you very much. Now why don't you make like a tree and get out of here? (2015 Biff gives 1955 Biff a slap across the head.) It's leave, you idiot! "Make like a tree, and leave." You sound like a damn fool when you say it wrong! Alright then, leave! (He throws the book in the back of the car. 2015 Biff catches it.) And take your book with you!Don't worry, Marty, she'll be fine. When you burned the almanac in 1955, the normal timeline was restored. That means once we're back in 1985, you just have to go over to the house to wake her up. (A giant machine begins working.) Oh, Marty, turn that valve over there all the way to the right. Yeah, turn it all the way around. Okay let's go! (The machine continues to work. Doc holds a pan next to a pipe. Suddenly a small brownish square shoots out. Doc picks it up with some tongs and drops it into a beaker of tea. He rattles it and offers it to Marty.) Iced tea?
